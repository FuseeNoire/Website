		<h1>Fus√©e Noire</h1>
		<p>A geopolitical Minecraft server.</p>
		
		<h2>What is Fus√©e Noire?</h2>
		<p>Fus√©e Noire is a bilingual geopolitical server for Minecraft. It's a real world-like simulation without a central big power intervening. This means we have a limited set of rules, mainly being not cheating and not harassing other players.</p>
		
		<h2>Cool, how does it work?</h2>
		<p>When you join the server, you'll have to either join a nation or start your own. If you decide to go on your own, you'll need more people to work in mass to produce resources and grow as a nation, since generating resources in Fus√©e Noire depends on cooperation with other players.</p>

		<h2>I'm convinced, how do I join?</h2>
		<p>As of August 2021, Fus√©e Noire is under heavy development. A public alpha is in the plans for the forseeable future, so stay tuned!</p>
